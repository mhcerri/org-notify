# mhcerri/org-notify

This is my folk of https://github.com/p-m/org-notify with some changes
that I find useful, including:

- New option to also check scheduled timestamps.
- Option to set a custom icon for desktop notifications.
- Option to set a default urgency for desktop notifications.
- A change to process all the agenda file at once.
